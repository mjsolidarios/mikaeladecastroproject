        <p>One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. </p>
        <img src="images/3.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>He was laughing at the turtle for being so slow.</p>
        <img src="images/4.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>Much to the rabbitâ€™s surprise, the turtle challenged him to a race.</p>
        <img src="images/5.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>The rabbit thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge.</p>
        <img src="images/6.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>The fox was to be the umpire of the race.</p>
        <img src="images/8.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought.</p>
        <img src="images/9.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere.</p>
        <img src="images/10.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be
            able to race to the finish line ahead of him. </p>
        <img src="images/11.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got.
            He just kept going.</p>
        <img src="images/12.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He could not see the turtle anywhere! </p>
        <img src="images/13.png" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>He went at full speed to the finish line but found the turtle there waiting for him.</p>
